# BudgetApp
This is a project to create a web application which allows to track your budget in a predefined time span. Back-End architecture will be based on C# and Front-End design will implement JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular. You will also find several approaches for learning purposes (from legacy SOA service technologies and usage of .NET Framework class libraries to the application of .NET 5 and .NET Standard 2.0 as a sample of porting, with Web REST API and SPA web pages).
